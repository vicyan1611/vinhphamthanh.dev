This is the third time I have re-created my portfolio (blog) website. Several reasons led me to this decision.

- I used [wordpress](https://wordpress.org/) engines for the previous two and the experience was not good. I couldn't control how my site worked and the features were too much for me to use all of them, I just wanted to write some posts.   
- I used shared hosting for the old ones and it cost me some bucks. This time, I host my website on [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/), so in theory, I can save some money to drink milk tea ^^ Netlify also supports continuous deployment so I don't need to worry about those parts.
- I want to make my website more minimalist and have more 'IT' vibes.
- hmm, I want to make my site look like the two of my idols [@ryan4yin](https://thiscute.world/en/) and [@ashpex](https://ashpex.eu.org/). Somehow, they use the same themes for their websites and maybe somehow I choose the same theme likes them ~
    - ryan4yin has written a lot of good posts about NixOS (which I am currently using because of his posts) and other things about tech. But a lot of his posts are written in Chinese, so maybe you need a translation tool to read them.
    - ashpex also wrote a lot of good posts about tech. And because she is an alumnus of my university, maybe I can 'copy' some codes for my projects ^^

I hope that I can continue to write on this blog for several years later without changing anything.
