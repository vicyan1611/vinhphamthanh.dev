I want to write this guide to share my experience with other people when they are choosing a laptop to buy for programming. I will discuss different parts of a computer and, in the end, suggest some laptops that are good for each use case. This is my guide when buying a new laptop. If you plan to buy a used one, you should know what you will sacrifice.

> Disclaimer: This is just my opinion, so take it with a grain of salt.

## Display

Don't think this part is not important, as a programmer and student, you will need to read many lines of code and a lot of textbooks.

If you don't plan to use your laptop with a discrete monitor, choose a laptop with at least a 15.6-inch display.

However, it is not only the size of the display; you need to carefully choose the resolution as well as the brightness. The brightness of the display also needs to be at least 350 nits, if not, you can't barely see anything when using your laptop outside of your room or outside of the classroom. With higher resolution, you can see the text and other things more clearly.

## Weight

Don’t assume you can comfortably carry a laptop that weighs over 2.2 kg. You'll also need to carry other items like textbooks in your backpack. A lightweight laptop will be more convenient for working outside or on the go.

## CPU

To be honest, the university curriculum doesn’t require an extremely powerful CPU. Most modern laptops are powerful enough for your needs. However, keep in mind that Apple Silicon has a different architecture compared to Intel and AMD processors. If you choose a MacBook, you will need to do more things when installing certain Windows software required by the curriculum.

To summarize:

- **Intel:** At least 12th generation
- **AMD:** The chip should be from 2022 or later
- **Apple Silicon:** Avoid the base M1 chip; other models will be sufficient

## Memory

You will need at least 16 GB of RAM, no matter what you plan to do. If you’re considering a laptop with 8 GB of RAM, check if the memory is upgradeable. If it is, upgrade it right away; if not, don’t buy it. Even if you opt for a MacBook, 8 GB of RAM won’t be sufficient. Don’t believe claims from some guys say that 8 GB of RAM in a MacBook is equivalent to 16 GB of RAM in a Windows laptop.

## Storage

At least a 512 GB SSD. Trust me, you'll need to install and use a lot of software and IDEs. More storage also provides greater flexibility; you won't have to constantly decide which programs to uninstall when you need to install new ones. Additionally, having ample storage can improve overall system performance and allow for better management of your projects and files. Investing in more storage now can save you from potential hassles and limitations in the future.

If you choose a MacBook, you can choose the 256GB version and buy an external SSD. This combination will save you some bucks.

## Battery

Buy a laptop with decent battery life; you won’t always be at home or have access to a charger everywhere you go. Not all locations will have an available electrical socket. Consider choosing a laptop without a discrete GPU and one that features the latest Intel Core Ultra or AMD Ryzen Gen 5 chip. These newer chips are better at energy efficiency, helping extend your laptop's battery life.

## GPU

I put the GPU last on the list because, for programming, you really don’t need a discrete GPU. Unless you’re into heavy gaming or doing a lot of video editing, the integrated GPU will do just fine. Going for a laptop with a dedicated GPU will cost you more and can significantly impact your battery life. So unless you’ve got specific needs that demand it, you’re better off saving the extra cash and sticking with the integrated option.

## Other things to note

If possible, get a laptop that supports Type-C charging. This way, you can ditch those heavy charging bricks and enjoy more freedom.

Also, don’t overlook the keyboard and touchpad. You’ll be typing a lot, so it’s worth making sure the keyboard is comfortable to use. A good typing experience can make a big difference in your overall comfort and productivity.

## Laptops that I recommend

- **ROG Zephyrus G14/G16 2023**: Right now, I’m using the G14 since I have a discrete monitor. This laptop ticks all the boxes I mentioned, plus it comes with an RTX card for gaming when I want to play games with friends. The downside is that it gets pretty hot during gaming sessions, but with a few tweaks, it’s not a problem.

- **Lenovo Thinkbooks/Ideapad 2024**: They come equipped with the latest Intel and AMD chips, which offer great energy efficiency and performance. You’ll also get a good display, and these laptops are lightweight with decent battery life.

- **I want to play AAA games**: If you’re into playing AAA games and aren’t too concerned about battery life or weight, you might want to check out the Lenovo Legion. It’s well-known for its impressive performance and top-notch cooling system, making it a great choice for gaming.

## Conclude

These are my criteria for buying a new laptop to ensure you have the most flexibility for your needs. If you can’t afford a laptop that meets all these criteria, you might need to make some compromises to fit your budget. I hope you find a laptop that suits you well.
