## About this blog
I write this blog because I want to save my knowledge for myself or share it with those who need that knowledge. This blog is also a record of my life adventure with technology and other things around me. 

I also want to improve my English writing skills, so maybe I will continue to write in English in the future. I also make a Vietnamese page for this website, but I'm too lazy to write.

I hope that you can find some good things that worth your time on my blog.
