            </div>I want to write this post to help me in the future, in case there are things happen, I need to reinstall NixOS again or figure out what happens with my systems. Because of the non-FHS and declarative nature of NixOS, it is harder than other distros when we want to do something or install some apps. I also hope that this post can also be a reference for other users too.]]></description>

            </div>This is the third time I have re-created my portfolio (blog) website. Several reasons led me to this decision.
I used wordpress engines for the previous two and the experience was not good. I couldn&rsquo;t control how my site worked and the features were too much for me to use all of them, I just wanted to write some posts.Â I used shared hosting for the old ones and it cost me some bucks.]]></description>
